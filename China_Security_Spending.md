Introduction
============

This is a byproduct of my project on local government debt in China and is inspired by a commentary piece by [Bruce Lui](https://news.mingpao.com/ins/文摘/article/20190313/s00022/1552399346888/中國維穩地圖-廣東「辣過」新疆（文-呂秉權）). In that piece, Lui, a reporter of RTHK implies that the survilliance in Guangzhou is *spiceier* than Xinjiang due to the higher spending in security. This headline, of course, can catch the eyeball of Hong Kong readers.

However, to gauge the intensity of security, there should be some better indicators, such as spending to tax ratio or per capita security spending. Since I've collected the data of provincial governmental spending from 2014 to 2017 for my local debt project, it is easy to visualize these data.

Security Spending in coulumn chart
==================================

As we can see from the chart, the per capita and security to GDP ratio shows quite a different story. Xinjiang used to be at lower rank but surge to the second place in 2017. And Tibet continuously remains at the first place (sad story).
